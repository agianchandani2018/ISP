This project now runs on the Pingry compsci-dev server at http://compsci-dev.pingry.k12.nj.us.1030


This project uses components of the [schoolopy](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/schoolopy) Python wrapper for the Schoology REST API.


# Future Implementation
Due to time constraints, unforeseen setbacks, and the unprecedented amount of time required to learn how to incorporate numerous different languages into this project, it is unlikely that we will be able to complete this project in time for the ISP presentations.

## Project Overview
The **GASP** (GitHub Assignment Student Portal) is an integration of GitHub into Schoology for the purpose of streamlining the process of creating repositories containing starter code for computer science assignments on GitHub and
